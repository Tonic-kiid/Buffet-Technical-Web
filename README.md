# Buffet-Technical-Web

I decided to create a login and a sign up page that i will use to build a more functional website as practice. 
To run the front-end 
Open terminal and type npm install to install the nod_modules that was not included in the file
cd into the login file after installing.
cd login
Enter npm start to run, react.
